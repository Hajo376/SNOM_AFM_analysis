Installation:
-------------

The package can be installed via ``pip``::

    pip install snom-analysis

Alternatively, you can clone the repository and install the package manually from github https://github.com/Hajo376/SNOM_AFM_analysis/.
If you install via pip all dependencies will be installed automatically. I recommend to use a virtual environment.
