Here we will discuss how to use the package and how to get started with it.
We will lateron also discuss additional features ant tricks to get the most out of the package.

How to use:
-----------

First of all install the package either from PyPi or by using a wheel from the dist folder.
You can also clone the repository and use it as is or create your own wheel by running pyhton setup.py bdist_wheel.
I would always recommend to use a virtual environment to install the package and use the wheel.

Then try out the example script which should be somewhere in the repository. (#todo)
Anyways, here is a short example of how to use the package:
